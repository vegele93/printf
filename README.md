Team ALX Project: Write your own printf function.

Collaborators: Prosper Ikiensikimama and Victor Egele.

REQUIREMENTS:

#General: Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 All your files should end with a new line A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl You are not allowed to use global variables No more than 5 functions per file The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h Don’t forget to push your header file All your header files should be include guarded Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project

#GitHub: There should be one project repository per group. The other members do not fork or clone the project to ensure only one of the team has the repository in their github account otherwise you risk scoring 0%

#Compilation: Your code will be compiled this way: $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions) Our main files will include your main header file (main.h): #include main.h You might want to look at the gcc flag -Wno-format when testing with your _printf and the standard printf. We strongly encourage you to work all together on a set of tests If the task does not specify what to do with an edge case, do the same as printf
